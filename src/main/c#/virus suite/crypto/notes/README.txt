CRYPTOCURRENCY BACKGROUND:



APPLICATION SUMMARY:
This application is essentially a clipboard listener that




FEATURES:
    -light memory footprint (7KB and uses about 16-19% cpu with 3.7MB RAM)
    -randomization with 10 addresses in order to create the impression that host is being targeted by different bad actors
    -name is social engineered for host to believe this file is a system process... thus they will be hesitant to delete it due to potential
    of computer being inoperative

FEATURES YET TO BE ADDED:
    -remove console window when running
    -continual persistence to host after while loop breaks
    -activation upon computer restart
    -self-replicating upon deletion
    -performance testing (does it crash after a certain period? Is ram/cpu usage intensive and disruptive when host uses other apps?)



WARNING:
