# :skull_and_crossbones: (ETH) WALLET ADDRESS SWAPPER :skull_and_crossbones:
 



### DISCLAIMER

## CRYPTOCURRENCY BACKGROUND
At the time of the write-up, Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency based on  market capitalization
whose purpose serves to be a platform crypto promoting other cryptos to branch off of. From a technical view,
this means that other cryptos who desire to possess some level of ETH attributes must follow it's interface known as the ERC20 protocol.
As a direct result of following such standard, progeny cryptos that extends or inherits the ETH protocol/interface
will have the same wallet address format that prefixes with 0x and is 42 characters long of randomly distributed alphanumeric text.
This is where this listener exploit becomes advantageous.
(FYI visit https://eidoo.io/erc20-tokens-list to see all ETH based cryptos.
Viewing this list should open your eyes to the yield potency behind this exploit if it were to live on a number of machines)





## SUMMARY
This application is a clipboard listener that swaps the client ethereum's wallet address
with wallet addresses declared within program. If host does not perform his/her due diligence
and sends their eth-based crypto while this application is running, those assets will have routed to
one of the 10 preset addresses permanently! Given the transparent nature of public blockchains, the victim
will undoubtedly be able to see where their funds went to through block explorers such as Blockchain.info.
As a warning, ramifications are not yet explored and there is a probability that there may exist
some crypto forensic agency that can associate wallet to an IP addresses so proceed with caution!!!





## COUNTERMEASURES IF INFECTED
If infected, you can painstakingly type out your address when doing a transaction or
copy the address in parts; the ladder being the most efficient.





## HOW TO OPERATE
``` 
csc .\sys_host_dl_v4.0.30319_69.cs
cd src/main/c#/scripts/powershell
./sys_host_dl_v4.0.30319_64_persistence.ps1
```




## FEATURES
    -light memory footprint (7KB file size that uses about 16-19% processor utilization with RAM usage recorded around 3.7MB)
    -randomization with 10 addresses in order to create the impression that host is being targeted by different bad actors
    -powershell listener that scans proc list to assure that this script continually runs after its condition is met once.
	This ensures the script's continuity as the victim will always be under the surveillance of the script's listener.
    -executable name is social engineered for host to believe this file belongs to the system.
     	Thus inexperienced victims may be hesitant to delete it due to the potential of their computer being inoperative.




 
## ROBUST FEATURES YET TO BE ADDED
    -remove or silence console window when running
    -remove logging writes to speed up performance
    -counter the countermeasure stated above
    -activation upon computer restart/shutdown
    -self-replicating file upon deletion
    -perform thorough performance testing (Is ram/cpu usage intensive or disruptive when host uses other apps?
					   Does it crash after a certain span of time? If so, why?)





## WARNING
As stated earlier, this software was created solely for educational purposes and is not meant to be distributed or exploited in any other ways.
Therefore, I am not held liable for the ramifications caused by such this software. Given the extremely high financial gain that can be yielded
through such software, be warned that an equal level of backlash will surely follow!
